Steps to install ccbench:
------------------------

1. Fix the Makefile (not always necessary)
   
   The Makefile sets some parameters based on which is the host you are running on.
   The parameters are:
       * PLATFORM : the platform name used to set platform specific parameters in the code
       * CC : the compiler to be used
       * CFLAGS : the compilation flags
       * LDFLAGS : the libraries to link with
       * VER_FLAGS : version flags, such as the platform name

   If a configuration is not specified, the DEFAULT configuration is used (it should work for most x86 platforms).

2. Compile for the target platform

   In the base folder of the project execute:
      make	  

3. ./moesi -h 

   You will get all the details you need in order to use the application.
